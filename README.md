# README

This repository is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault aimed at helping **Blue Teams** prepare for the [NCAE Cyber Games](https://www.ncaecybergames.org). It's currently a work in progress and some notes are incomplete.

To view and edit these notes, you can download the repo and open them in any markdown editor/viewer you'd like - though **they are intended to be opened as a vault within Obsidian**.

This page (the README) is intended to be the homepage within this vault. You can access all pages from here.

> **The competition this year is going to be using a MicroTik router, *NOT CentOS* (as it is no longer maintained)**. This was announced on the NCAE Discord.
>
> A new video was posted on the NCAE channel that goes over the new Mini Hack in the same way as the old one. It's very similar to the first Mini Hack and approachable even if you haven't watched the rest of the playlist after the video for the first Mini Hack.
