- **Creating Directories with `mkdir`**  
	- `mkdir` (Make Directory) creates new folders.  
	- Requires an argument (folder name) to specify the directory to create.  
	- Can create folders using **relative paths** (within the current location) or **absolute paths** (specifying the full location).  
- **Absolute vs. Relative Paths**  
	- **Absolute Paths** begin with `/`, referencing the root of the file system (e.g., `/home/sandbox/Desktop/Folder`).  
	- **Relative Paths** do not start with `/`, assuming the current directory as the starting point.  
	- Knowing whether to use an absolute or relative path is crucial for efficient navigation.  
- **Verifying Directory Contents**  
	- `ls` lists the contents of directories.  
	- You can check the contents of a directory without navigating into it by using `ls <directory-path>`.  
	- Tab completion (`Tab` key) helps avoid typos when typing long paths.  
- **Navigating and Understanding File Structure**  
	- GUI requires navigation to a folder before creating files, but the command line allows creation anywhere.  
	- Tilde `~` represents the user's home directory, making it a shortcut for specifying locations.
